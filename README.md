# Name-Chakra-Deva Explorer

This Streamlit app analyzes names or phrases in English Latin script or Devanagari, converting them to Sanskrit to map phonetic components to chakras, emotions (bhavas), aesthetic feelings (rasas), and Vedic Devas. It generates a descriptive prose narrative linking the inputâ€™s energy to Devas, using a dataset of 33 Vedic Devas with their roles, elements, and Vahana symbolisms. The app features tabs for Name Analysis, Deva Explorer, Chakras, Bhavas and Rasas, Vedic Devas, and How It Works, with an interactive Plotly chart.
